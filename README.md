## Purpose of Project

The Rental & Services Management System project is dedicated to facilitating the moving-in process for international and in-state students. With a special focus on those attending Indiana University of Bloomington, the platform offers comprehensive property listings and centralizes essential information, thereby streamlining the apartment search process. It also provides tools for informed decision-making and simplifies access to moving-in services, fostering a community feel for students in transition.

## Approach

Our approach integrates the MERN stack with Agile methodology, emphasizing in-house development to cater to the unique needs of IUB off-campus students. With phased delivery and adaptive technology evaluation, we ensure a responsive and tailored system that enhances the property rental and moving-in experience for international students.
